[There are no accidents. Everything is right just the way it is. There are no mistakes. you are in your right place going through those experiences that are necessary for you. There is nothing wrong. When you begin to appreciate this you will realize that the universe does not punish you, there is no God that punishes you, there is no world that is against you. Things appear to happen in your lives because it’s necessary for your spiritual unfoldment at this time. What appears to be bad is really a blessing in disguise. What appears to be good may be a hindrance to you. This is why you should never judge yourself. You have to have faith in the powers that be. As you have faith enough you will become happy, just by being yourself.](https://gatheringofwisdom.wordpress.com/2019/09/16/there-are-no-accidents/)

Every move you make, everything you do is supposed to happen. If you will just realize this you will stop worrying. This is what I meant when I said in the beginning you are in your right place right now. Going through those experiences that are necessary for you. The worst thing you can do is to condemn yourself and your lot. This just pulls you deeper into maya. Be happy where you are. Never compare yourself with anyone. Be yourself just the way you are. Be thankful for what you are and where you are. It is only by being thankful, by acceptance that you begin to let go of your humanity. Every time you resist you’re accruing greater karma to you. Every time you try to stick up for your rights you are accruing greater karma to you. And you will always have rights to stick up for. Only the nature of them will change. But you will be sticking up for your rights all of your life. And then you will take up another body and continue doing the same thing it’ll never end.

Finally, try to remember that the powers that be loves you just the way you are. It doesn’t love you when you do certain things. It loves you just the way you are, unconditionally. And you are unfolding in your own inimitable way. There is absolutely nothing wrong with anything. Collectively the earth is going through its karma and is doing what it’s supposed to do. Your job is to become realized and totally free. You do this by accepting yourself with the way you are, accepting everybody else. Accepting the world the way it is. Accepting conditions the way they are. Realizing that none of these things exist they’re only temporary. And what is temporary cannot be reality. Understanding that the true reality is yourself. There is no true reality outside of yourself. There is nothing going on outside of yourself. You are the creator of the world and of the universe. And that all is well.
