21st-century people really like being noisy. Loud music loud cars, loud talking, loud kids, just loud everything. Nice to find a quiet corner somewhere and smell the flowers. Then they like to be fast, fast on the roads, quick in the supermarket, quick at the boat ramp, pushy, impatient, and fast. One minute delay at the lights they jump on their horn. Quick or the dead. They have created an environment of impatient and stress. Only one thing that matters to them is them and their goals. Nothing else, oh, and their designer dogs.
