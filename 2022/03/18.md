Đại âm vô thanh, đại tượng vô hình

The boy-scout rule—where does it come from anyway?
In 1941, the founder of the scouts,  Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell said, 'Try and leave this world a little better than you found it.' Over time, this may have morphed into, 'Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it,' but the sentiment is more-or-less the same. The point is that small but consistent efforts to keep the campground clean avoid a massive clean-up operation down the line.
