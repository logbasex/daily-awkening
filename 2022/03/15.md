People always tell introverts to be more talkative and leave their comfort zones. yet no one tells extroverts to shut up to make the zone comfortable.

I wish we had the ability to dream together with other people. Like multi-player dreaming.

[The regret at having stayed up late and waking tired is often replaced by the desire to stay up late the next night](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/tef3kr/the_regret_at_having_stayed_up_late_and_waking/)
- The trick isn't to go to bed earlier, (at least not for me, a non-morning person/night owl) but instead waking up and going up earlier. Not so much a trick since it's hella hard, but it's much easier for me to force myself up from bed earlier than it is to force myself to go to bed earlier. Eventually going to bed earlier becomes natural because if you've managed not to nap during the day you'll be tired in the appropriate time!
